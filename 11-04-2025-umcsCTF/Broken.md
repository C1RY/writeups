I had never encountered a challenge involving a broken MP4 file before. Based on some research, I discovered that there are tools available to repair corrupted MP4 files. My first approach was to try one of these websites:  [Free Video Repair Online: Fix Corrupted MP4/MOV in Minutes](https://repair.easeus.com/#upload)

After the website finished repairing the video, I played the file and that is when I saw the flag.
